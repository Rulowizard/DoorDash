# DoorDash
Take-home project
For this solution I decided to create a While loop that would help me move along the array of numbers. With this approach the code will have a Big O of O(N).
I included user validation input.
“Indice” helps me to define the initial position of the subarray. “largo_sub” defines the number of elements that will be taken for the sub array. 
The while loop plays with the index and largo sub to identify the possible arrays that comply with the constraints defined by the exercise.
